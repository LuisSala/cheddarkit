# CheddarKit

**Important:** Cheddar for iOS is no longer maintained by Nothing Magical. It has been [sold](http://sam.roon.io/parting-ways-with-cheddar). Going forward, Cheddar is no longe open source since the new owner has choosen to keep it private. This will remain as an archive of the previous version that was open source. Everything should still work. Thank you to everyone for your support as I built Cheddar. Seriously. Thank you.
